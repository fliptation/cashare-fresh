        "As a pioneer in crowdlending, we now have the largest active 'crowd' in Switzerland and have financed more P2P loans than any other provider – with numbers continuing to grow!",
        "Crowdlending has long since established itself as a real alternative for individuals and businesses. While banks often neglect smaller loans and offer less attractive interest rates, the FinTech sector – and Cashare with it – stands out with fair and flexible solutions. The opportunities offered by crowdlending are enormous – and they continue to expand.",
