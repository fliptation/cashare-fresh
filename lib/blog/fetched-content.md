## Article 1: Flexiblere Zinszahlungen für endfällige Darlehen

**Live URL:** https://www.cashare.ch/flexiblere-zinszahlungen-fuer-endfaellige-darlehen/

Cashare has expanded its offerings with a significant new feature: flexible interest payment structuring for bullet loans. This innovation benefits both borrowers and investors by providing options beyond the traditional maturity-date-only payment model.

### What's New?

Previously, borrowers repaid interest and principal simultaneously at term end. The platform now offers flexible payment intervals:

- **Monthly interest payments**
- **Quarterly interest payments**
- **Bullet payments** (original maturity-date model)

This reduces the financial strain on borrowers while enabling investors to receive regular income throughout the loan term.

### How It Works

Interest payments follow the selected schedule, displayed in the "Interest Due Date" column for each loan project.

**Example scenario:** A CHF 1 million loan at 12% interest over 12 months with quarterly payments means investors receive CHF 30,000 every three months, proportional to their investment amount.

### Key Benefits

- **Enhanced security:** Enables prompt legal action if interest payments are missed
- **Predictable returns:** Investors receive consistent interest distributions
- **Borrower flexibility:** Allows extended terms and reduces end-of-term financial burden

### What Remains Unchanged

Bullet loans continue serving as an attractive SME financing option. The original single-payment model at maturity remains available for those preferring this structure.

## Article 2: Begrenztes Wachstum des traditionellen Kredits fördert in der Schweiz Crowdfunding

**Live URL:** https://www.cashare.ch/begrenztes-wachstum-des-traditionellen-kredits-foerdert-in-der-schweiz-crowdfunding/

According to the Swiss Bankers Association's 2024 Banking Barometer, Switzerland's banking sector showed positive overall development in 2023. However, expert forecasts predict subdued credit growth in 2024, combined with limited real estate supply and stricter regulations. These factors are expected to encourage borrowers to explore crowdfunding as an alternative to traditional financing.

### Three Key Drivers of Crowdfunding Growth

#### 1. Limited Access to Traditional Credit

With mortgage credit growth predicted to be modest in 2024, certain real estate projects may struggle to secure adequate bank financing. This gap creates opportunities for crowdfunding platforms to position themselves as attractive alternatives for property developers and individuals seeking project funding.

#### 2. Diversification of Financing Sources

Corporate lending is increasingly shifting away from traditional banks toward non-bank providers. Crowdfunding platforms operating outside conventional banking frameworks can offer direct and transparent financing solutions, positioning themselves as viable alternatives to restrictive conventional credit structures.

#### 3. Flexibility and Speed

In an environment with increasingly stringent regulations and frequent legal challenges, crowdfunding stands out for its agility. Unlike traditional banks, crowdfunding platforms can provide less bureaucratic financing solutions, helping borrowers overcome obstacles associated with conventional credit, particularly in sectors like real estate where rapid financing is critical.

### Conclusion

The current market conditions create favorable conditions for crowdfunding development in Switzerland as a response to traditional credit market challenges.

## Article 3: Zinsentwicklung 2024 – Zins quo vadis?

**Live URL:** https://www.cashare.ch/zinsentwicklung-2024-zins-quo-vadis-2/

The volatile interest rate situation has stabilized after an initial phase of increases. Long-term, we remain in an environment with elevated rates.

### Interest Rate Development Context

In 2022, inflation rose significantly, reaching a peak of 3.5 percent. In response, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) raised its base rate five consecutive times, reaching 1.75 percent by late 2023.

Thanks to these measures, inflation declined substantially and now sits below 2 percent—aligning with the SNB's price stability target. Consequently, the SNB halted further rate increases in December 2023.

### Outlook for 2024 Interest Rates

**Expected Timeline:**
- The SNB was anticipated to hold rates steady through spring 2024
- First rate cuts expected in Q2 2024, potentially coordinated with the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve
- Overall expectations: three rate cuts during 2024, lowering the base rate from 1.75% to 1%

**Influencing Factors:**
- Unexpectedly weak January inflation data created potential for earlier spring cuts
- SARON-indexed mortgage rates stand to benefit directly from SNB reductions due to their tight correlation with the base rate
- Capital markets had already priced in anticipated rate cuts, limiting expected movement in long-term government bond yields

### Why Cashare Offers Attractive Interest Rates

**Crowdlending Advantage:**
Cashare connects borrowers and investors directly through its platform, bypassing traditional banking infrastructure. This "completely bank-free process" enables competitive rates.

**Rate Range:**
- Available rates: 3.9% to 9.9%
- Rates vary by borrower rating and loan term

## Article 4: Der Crowdfunding Monitor 2024

**Live URL:** https://www.cashare.ch/crowdfunding-monitor-2024/

The Crowdfunding Monitor 2024 from Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU) has been released. This annual report from the Institute for Financial Services Zug (IFZ) provides development insights on Swiss crowdfunding, covering crowdlending, crowdinvesting, and crowdonating.

### Market Review and Development

#### Overall Crowdlending Trends

The Swiss crowdlending market experienced a 20% decline in 2023, with volumes falling from CHF 497.5 million to CHF 398.1 million. Despite this contraction, crowdlending remains the largest segment in Switzerland's crowdfunding sector.

#### Segment-Specific Performance

**Business Crowdlending (SME Credits):**
- 2023 volume: CHF 132.8 million
- Decline: 6.4% year-over-year

## Article 5: Digitalisierung der Finanzmärkte – Ihre Chancen und Risiken

**Live URL:** https://www.cashare.ch/digitalisierung-der-finanzmaerkte-ihre-chancen-und-risiken/

The digital transformation fundamentally reshapes financial markets at a rapid pace. Fresh business approaches, technological innovations, and financial products emerge continuously.

### The Changing Financial Landscape

Traditional banking structures centered on deposits and credit are being fundamentally reshaped by digital innovations. New financial companies emerge alongside established institutions, offering either specialized services (FinTechs) or comprehensive offerings beyond traditional finance (BigTechs).

### Digital Business Models and Associated Risks

#### BigTechs and Market Dominance

Technology giants including Microsoft, Apple, and META could become financial sector leaders, leveraging significant network effects and Big Data capabilities.

#### FinTech Competition

Specialized FinTechs offer simplified, affordable financial services through scalability advantages, focusing on product development and customer retention.

#### Consumer Benefits and Risks

Digital services provide improvements—simpler interfaces, personalized products, lower costs—but introduce risks including questionable business practices, anti-money laundering challenges, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

### Opportunities: Crowdlending Innovation

Crowdlending represents a digital-enabled investment innovation where investors directly lend to businesses or individuals without traditional banking intermediaries. This model offers three key advantages:

- **Direct Transparency**: Investors understand precisely where capital flows and expected returns
- **Attractive Returns**: Eliminated intermediary costs allow interest rates determined directly between borrowers and lenders
- **Risk Diversification**: Capital distribution across multiple projects helps offset potential losses

## Article 6: Abrakadabra, so wirst du zu deiner eigenen Bank!

**Live URL:** https://www.cashare.ch/abrakadabra-so-wirst-du-zu-deiner-eigenen-bank/

Traditionally, banks served as the primary institutions for people seeking to invest or grow their wealth. While this remains largely true today, new investment avenues have emerged in recent years. One significant development is P2P-Lending, commonly referred to as Crowdlending.

### Cashare's Crowdlending Model

Cashare is a Swiss P2P-Lending platform enabling both private and institutional investors to build customized investment portfolios. The platform empowers the "crowd" to select specific projects for investment, shifting decision-making authority from traditional bank advisors to individual investors themselves.

### Key Advantages Over Traditional Banking

#### Greater Flexibility and Broader Selection

- Investors construct personalized portfolios independently
- Access diverse credit and investment opportunities from multiple providers
- Potential returns reaching up to 10% annually
- Online management eliminates time-consuming bank appointments

#### Enhanced Transparency and Choices

The platform provides comprehensive project information including borrower details, loan amounts, terms, and interest rates, enabling investors to align selections with personal risk tolerance and objectives.

#### Autonomy and Self-Determination

Investors maintain complete control over their investment strategy, independently deciding which projects to fund and investment amounts.

#### Additional Benefits

- **Security:** Credit screening and default insurance protect investor capital
- **Cost Efficiency:** Platform fees typically undercut traditional banking charges
- **Convenience:** Fully online accessibility allows portfolio management anytime, anywhere

## Article 7: Unrecht? Banken scheffeln Millionen, aber Kunden müssen draufzahlen!

**Live URL:** https://www.cashare.ch/unrecht-banken-scheffeln-millionen-aber-kunden-muessen-draufzahlen/

Swiss banks achieved substantial profits of 6.52 billion Swiss francs in 2022, despite declining revenues since 2019. A primary driver of these earnings has been rising interest margins following the Swiss National Bank's rate increases designed to combat inflation.

### Why Banks Aren't Passing Rate Increases to Customers

#### Interest Margin Strategy

Domestic banks generate approximately 75% of profits from interest-based activities. This dynamic creates incentive structures favoring wider margins rather than equitable rate adjustments.

#### Current Savings Rates

Most Swiss banks currently offer very low rates, with average returns at approximately 0.5% annually. This disparity has drawn criticism from consumer advocates and policymakers.

### Crowdlending as an Alternative

#### Advantages Over Traditional Banking

Peer-to-peer lending eliminates intermediaries, enabling:
- Higher interest rates (often reaching 10% annually)
- Greater flexibility in investment selection
- Direct participation in loan decisions

#### Cashare AG as a Model

Cashare AG, Switzerland's pioneering crowdlending platform founded in 2008, demonstrates this alternative's viability:
- Over 50,000 members
- Approximately 4,000 facilitated loan projects
- Maintained stable performance during COVID-19
- Offers transparency and competitive rates

## Article 8: Vollmacht vs. Vorsorgeauftrag

**Live URL:** https://www.cashare.ch/eine-immer-wiederkehrende-frage-bzw-feststellung-vollmacht-vs-vorsorgeauftrag/

There is a widespread misconception in society where people believe a power of attorney fully addresses their needs. However, the legislator and Swiss voters established the "Vorsorgeauftrag" (advance directive) in 2013 to handle matters arising when someone loses decision-making capacity.

### Key Issue: Power of Attorney Becomes Invalid

A Federal Court decision established that all powers of attorney are annulled when incapacity occurs. The reasoning is logical—advance directives were created specifically for this purpose.

### Understanding the Vorsorgeauftrag

The advance directive covers legal representation, making traditional powers of attorney unnecessary. However, the directive must be validated by the KESB (child and adult protection authority) to take legal effect.

### Recommendation

Professional consultation on these matters provides security and peace of mind during stressful periods.

## Article 9: Mehr Effizienz und Nutzererlebnis bei Kreditverlängerungen

**Live URL:** https://www.cashare.ch/mehr-effizienz-und-nutzererlebnis-bei-kreditverlaengerungen/

Cashare announced a system improvement designed to streamline the credit renewal process. The update enables investors to maintain their positions in existing short-term loans more conveniently.

### What's New and How It Works

#### Renewal Timeline and Process

KMU (small and medium-sized enterprise) borrowers with bullet loans receive the opportunity to extend their credit 60 days before the current term expires. Investors have seven days to decide whether they wish to maintain their investment position.

#### Enhanced Investor Experience

Investors can now activate the renewal directly through their Cashare account with a single button click. The platform now provides:
- Better cost transparency
- Faster notifications

## Article 10: Vorsorgeauftrag – Patientenverfügung und Vollmachten

**Live URL:** https://www.cashare.ch/vorsorgeauftrag-patientenverfuegung-und-vollmachten/

Cashare partners with Jürg Gyr's financial services firm to support customers with guardianship planning.

### The Problem Without Proper Documentation

When someone loses decision-making capacity without a care directive, power of attorney, or advance directive, their autonomy becomes severely restricted.

### Three Essential Documents

**1. Care Directive (Vorsorgeauftrag)**
Designates a representative for personal care decisions, financial management, and legal representation.

**2. Advance Medical Directive (Patientenverfügung)**
Specifies binding decisions about medical treatment preferences, care arrangements, and life-sustaining measures.

**3. Power of Attorney (Vollmacht)**
Must include clauses ensuring validity beyond the grantor's death and continued effectiveness if grantor loses capacity.
